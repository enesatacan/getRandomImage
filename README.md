# getRandomImage


To view the photos randomly, please click on the get images button

This project aims to display one of four photos from a photo pool randomly by clicking a button.

The photos are stored in an array, and random index numbers are generated using the Math.random() and Math.floor() methods. The photo corresponding to the generated index is then displayed on the screen sequentially using useState in combination with the spread operator.

(remember to run npm install in the terminal)
